\title{Improved Sampling for Temporal Anti-Aliasing}


\begin{document}

\theabstract{Graphic Real-time applications, like video games, require solutions for jaggies and pixel flickering in movement problems, aliasing, to render high-quality images. In this thesis, we improved the Temporal Anti-Aliasing technique to provide higher quality images.}


{\noindent Current computer graphics real-time applications strive to provide the highest image quality available at the lowest computation time possible, they normally need to run at 30 images (frames) per second or more. One of the obstacles its got to overpass is that normally there is not enough resolution to render everything the best way possible, thus, creating what is commonly referred as jaggies or the blocky look that some rendered images get (officially named Spatial Aliasing); and pixel flickering or jumps in moving objects (Temporal Aliasing).

This thesis works improved one of the current Anti-Aliasing techniques, Temporal Anti-Aliasing, which mitigates the effect of Spatial and Temporal Aliasing using previously rendered frames in the process of rendering the current one. The key benefits that this technique provide are that it solves two types of aliasing problems at the same time; that it is compatible with current rendering pipelines and that it provides good results while being lightweight in computational time. But, itâ€™s got two main drawbacks, it generates unnecessary blurriness; and the appearance of trails of objects from previous frames that were moving (ghosting). 

The work of this thesis achieved a reduction in both drawbacks by the use of edge detection, using the Sobel Operator, and by numbering (indexing) models in the scene to differentiate them. Also, the improvements managed to be at the same level or surpass other Anti-Aliasing solutions like FXAA and SMAA, which are common in video games.
